Airport Management System Requirement Document - AirSyncHK

Introduction

Purpose
	This document aims to specify the requirements in developing an efficient operational system that automates processes of flight scheduling, baggage handling, improving safety standards and security through robust monitoring and maintenance, and elevating the staff's experience with user-friendly interfaces and real-time information.

Scope
	Key functionalities include flight scheduling, baggage tracking, runway management, data analytics, alerts, lost and found, and account management. The proposed system will integrate with existing external systems such as air traffic control and weather services while providing real-time data analytics and reporting capabilities. The project  will be an internal web service for airport management.
	
Overview
	AirSyncHK seeks to create a thorough solution that promotes efficiency, safety and passenger satisfaction while aligning the airport for future growth.
